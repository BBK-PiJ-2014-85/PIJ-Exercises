/*Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, with tw
o fields of type double (e.g. x, y) and the
following methods:
distanceTo(Point):
calculates the distance to another point.
distanceToOrigin():
calculates the distance to the origin. Implement it by calling the first m
ethod.
moveTo(double x, double y):
changes the coordinates of this point to be the given parameters x
and y.
moveTo(Point):
changes the coordinates of this point to move where the given point
is.
4
clone():
returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.
opposite():
returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates multiplied b
y
âˆ’
1.
Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as t
heir parameters are different. This is
called
method overloading
and we will see more of that in the future.*/
